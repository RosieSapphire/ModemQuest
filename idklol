Some people say Steve is made out of blocks
Some say he's made out of pixels and rocks
Pixels and rocks, and lines of code
A rough-start man with a mind that's cold

You chop 16 trees, what is your wealth?
Another stack of wood and lower in health
St. Personn, don't you call me, cuz from what I've observed
I owe my soul to the Minecraft world
