# MODEMQUEST
ModemQuest is a currently ill-defined videogame about a scentient dialup modem
on the quest to find out who's hogging the phone line or something.

Like I said, ill-defined so far. It's just a few simple ideas me and my
boyfriend threw together and I decided to code it. :D

This README might update a lot throughout the game's development, and it not,
it's probably because I forgot about it. :p
